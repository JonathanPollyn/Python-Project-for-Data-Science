# Python-Project-for-Data-Science
IBM Project
# Introduction
In this IBM project, I played the role of a Data Scientist/data analyst, working for a new startup investment business that assists consumers with stock investments. My assigned goal is to use Python libraries and web scraping on prominent stocks to extract financial data such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports from multiple sources. I will see the data in a dashboard to look for patterns or trends after I have collected it. Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop are the equities I will be working with.

Analytics are shown on the dashboard.

A dashboard frequently gives a clear picture of critical performance metrics. It will be practiced analyzing data collection and identifying essential performance indicators.
